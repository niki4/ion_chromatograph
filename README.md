# ion_chromatograph
My thesis on modelling Ion Chromatography system for The Kazan State Technical University, Department: Technical Cybernetics and Informatic.

This thesis was defended on 2009 as final challenge for obtaining Master degree in Specialty: #230101 "The Computing machines, complexes, systems and networks"

The main programm is written using a visual programming language G, designed by National Instruments.

**NB**. Most of the labels on the are done in russian language, but I'm planning to make and share a separate model with translation to english.

# Installation

In order to open and work with the model of Ion Chromatograph you need to open it with [LabView](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LabVIEW) platform.

To get the ability to store data in DB you could need [LabVIEW Database Connectivity Toolkit](http://sine.ni.com/nips/cds/view/p/lang/ru/nid/209060) and [ADO-Tool](http://forum.ib-berger.com/index.php?showtopic=27) installed.
